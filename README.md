# Policing-in-Bahrain
This Data Analytics Project on Predictive Policing in Bahrain is an extensive examination of algorithmic policing strategies, where a significant dataset is scrutinized to assess the reliability and societal effects of such methods. I focused on the analytical processing of the data and the creation of interactive visual aids to communicate our findings.

Using programming languages like Python, especially libraries for data analysis and visualization such as Pandas and Plotly, we dealt with several key datasets including:

departments.csv: A dataset listing all the clients represented within the broader dataset, indicating the stakeholders or participants in the predictive policing programs.
pp_report_locations_geocoded.csv: This contained geocoded details for the locations analyzed by the predictive algorithms, essential for mapping and spatial analysis.
census-block_group-household_income.csv and census-block_group-race_ethnicity.csv: These provided a socio-economic backdrop, allowing us to understand the demographics of the communities where predictive policing was being applied.
The project aimed to tackle several critical issues:

Predictive Inaccuracy Concerns: We scrutinized cases where the predictive algorithm may have failed, marking non-criminal sites like police stations as potential crime hotspots.

Social Impact of Predictive Patrols: We identified regions where algorithm-based policing could lead to severe social consequences, like increased surveillance in public housing that could potentially lead to evictions or heightened tension.

International Use of Predictive Policing: We delved into the intriguing use of U.S.-developed predictive policing technologies in Bahrain, trying to comprehend the reasons behind specific areas being targeted more frequently and the implications thereof during periods of prediction.

The project was not only about analyzing data but also about visual storytelling. Through scatter_mapbox in Plotly, we created interactive maps to visualize the discrepancies between predicted and actual incidents, the spatial distribution of policing focus, and the correlation with socio-economic factors, ultimately questioning the validity and impact of predictive policing practices.
